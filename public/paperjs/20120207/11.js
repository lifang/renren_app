We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus our attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home, Internet, and direct mail. </p>\n<p><br></p><p>Television </p>\n<p>Television is an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication. But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it. </p>\n<p>Television's influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. The Golf Channel, for instance, is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous(\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u7279\u70b9\u7684) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers.&nbsp;This has also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.</p>\n<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Newspaper</p>\n<p>After television, the medium attracting the next largest annual ad revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually. It has increased its national circulation (\u53d1\u884c\u91cf) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in 168 cities. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium. </p>\n<p>Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer, more detailed message to their audience than they can through television. Given new production techniques, advertisements can be printed in newspapers in about 48 hours, meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the massage out. Newspapers are often the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local readers.</p>\n<p><br></p><p>Radio</p>\n<p>Advertising on radio continues to grow. Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor billboards (\u5e7f\u544a\u724c) and the Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeat their ads often. Internet companies are also turning to radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day. Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Two major changes\u2014satellite and Internet radio\u2014will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart. </p><p><br></p>\n<p>Magazines </p>\n<p>Newsweeklies, women\u2019s titles, and business magazines have all seen in increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market. Magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television&nbsp;attracts&nbsp;all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous. If you read \"Sports Illustrated\", for example, you have much in common with the magazine\u2019s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisers using the print media - magazines and newspapers - will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the Internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers. These audiences will be more diverse and geographically dispersed(\u5206\u6563) than in the past. Second,&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.</p><p><br></p>\n<p>Out-of-home advertising</p><p>Out-of-home advertising, also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly&nbsp;effective&nbsp;way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. &nbsp;Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. &nbsp;Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective. &nbsp;Technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past. &nbsp;Using digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. &nbsp;This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they can change their messages more quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Internet </p>\n<p>As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market. As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease.&nbsp;The challenge to Internet advertisers is to create ads that audience members remember.&nbsp;</p><p>Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations\u2019 advertising in the near&nbsp;future. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the online medium as well.</p><p><br></p>\n<p>Direct mail&nbsp;</p><p>A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client's message. Direct mail includes newsletters, postcards and special promotions. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers. For many businesses, direct mail is the most effective from of advertising.</p>\n                    ","category":"2","questions":{"question":[{"correct_type":"0","id":"21","score":"0.0","description":"Television is an attractive advertising medium in that_____________.","questionattrs":"A) it has large audiences ;-;B) it appeals to housewives ;-;C) it helps build up a company\u2019s reputation ;-;D) it is affordable to most advertisers","tags":"\u5feb\u901f\u9605\u8bfb"},{"correct_type":"0","id":"347","score":"0.0","description":"With the increase in the number of TV channels_________.

We will argue over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed.<br>\n\tAl Gore calls global warming an \"inconvenient truth,\" as if merely recognizing it could put us on a path to a solution. But the real truth is that we don't know enough to relieve global warming, and - without major technological breakthroughs - we can't do much about it.<br>\n\tFrom 2003 to 2050,the world's population is projected to grow from 6.4 billion to 9.1 billion, a 42% increase.If energy use per person and technology remain te same, total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions(mainly, CO2) will be 42% higher in 2050. But that\u2019s too low, because societies that grow richer use more energy. We need economic growtht unless we condemn the world's poor to their persent poverty and freeze everyone else's living standards.With modest growth, energy use and greenhouse emissions more than double by 2050.<br>\n\tNo government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and personal freeom (limits on electrity usage, driving and travel)that might cut bach global warming. Still, politicians want to show they\u2019re \u201cdoing something.\u201d Consider the Kyoto Protocol(\u4eac\u90fd\u8bae\u5b9a\u4e66). It allowed countries that joined to punish those that didn't. But it hasn't reduced CO2 emissions(up about 25% since 1990), and many signatories(\u7b7e\u5b57\u56fd) didn't adopt tough enough policies to hit their 2008-2012 targets. The practical conclusion is that if global warming is a potential disaster, the only solution is new technology. Only an aggressive research and development program might find ways of breaking our dependence on fossil fuels or dealing with it. The trouble with the global warming debate is that it has become a moral proble when it\u2019s really an engineering one.

But few boundaries remain. The digital bread crumbs(\u788e\u5c51)you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to reconstruct who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can reveal what you think. Like it or not, increasingly we live in a world where you simply cannot keep a secret.<br>\n\tThe key question is: Does that matter? For many Americans, the answer apparently is \u201cno.\u201d When opinion polls ask Americans <br>\n\tabout privacy, most say they are concerned about losting it. A survery found an overwhelming pessimism about privacy, with 60 percent of respondents saying they feel their privacy is \u201cslipping away, and that bothers me.\u201d<br>\n\tBut people say one thing and do another. Only a tiny fraction of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserver their privacy.
